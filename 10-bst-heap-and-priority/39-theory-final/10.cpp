Counting sort’s time complexity is O(n) and space complexity is O(n + (n+1) + n).
Heap sort’s time complexity is O(nlogn) and space complexity is O(n).

Counting sort is not good for negative numbers and it is space complexity is worst.
Heap sort uses heapify algorithm.
Heapify algorithm time complexity is O(log n).
Heap sort calls “n” times in heapify function.
it’s time complexity is O(nlogn) and space complexity O(n).
It sorts any type of negative or positive data.

The Heap sort algorithm can be implemented as an in-place sorting algorithm. This means that its memory usage is minimal because apart from what is necessary to hold the initial list of items to be sorted, it needs no additional memory space to work.
So we clearly can see heapify is better than counting sort.
